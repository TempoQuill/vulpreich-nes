Overworld collision works on a per-tile basis.  There are two tables for each non-ASCII tile: pixel offsets and attributes.  SIDE NOTE: Non-ASCII tiles start at $7d, and wrap around to $1f.

Pixel Offsets:
	Offsets operate on crumbs paired together to form the base boundaries of a tile's dimension.  Each nybble represents a specific dimension:
		HI - Horizontal
		LO - Vertical
	Each crumb specifies a boundary where a metasprite may walk in each perspective shot:
		0 - Off
		1 - 2 pixels
		2 - 4 pixels
		3 - 6 pixels
	If both crumbs in a nybble are equal as and non-zero, the other nybble is left to specify which area a given metasprite is permitted to walk.

	If a nyble is zero, the metasprite can walk anywhere in the tile within that dimension.

Attributes:
	There are two main attributes to collision detection in VulpReich: Collision configuration and jump/action parameters.

	Configuration is stored in a single flag, which determines whether to OR collision or NOR entry based on collision
		0 - Exclusive, any collision stops a metasprite
		1 - Inclusive, collision only occurs where horizontal and vertical bounds intersect.
	Action is a 7-bit value separated into 3 parts: a high value, a low value, and a flag in between that indicates if there's a special property to begin with.
		0-2 - Offset to jump down from
		3   - Action flag
		4-6 - Offset to jump up from
	If no offset is given for the action flag to interpret it's up the engine to decide what happens at that tile based on the current area.
